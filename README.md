# Powershell-minigame

## Backstory
This small project was made back in the beginning of 2021, at a point where I was working on a project requiring me to learn powershell automation in the effort of creating and managing a large bulk of windows users. It was made in an attempt to convince my coworkers how greate powershell was, as I set myself the challenge to create something in resemblance to a game in powershell (I do not recommend you do this).

## Functionallity 
The game is quite simple, with a menu and 3 different minigames to choose from: `slots` , `horse racing` and a 50/50 `coin flip`.

### Example
